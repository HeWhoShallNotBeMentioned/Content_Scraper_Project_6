#### By _**{Chris Underwood}**_

## Description

_{This application pulls information about the latest shirts on the website http://www.shirts4mike.com/. Date scraped is the shirt page url, shirt img url, shirt title, price, and the time the data was gathered. The date is pulled by x-ray npm module and processed into csv format by json2csv npm module. There is an error message configured for when the system is unable to retrieve data. A custom start procedure has been created: npm start.}_

## Setup/Installation Requirements


_{Download the files into a folder of your choice. Move to that folder on the command line. Run npm start from the command line to activate the program. If it runs successfully, you will have information in the data folder. If it does not run successfully, you should have an error in the scraper-error.log file.}_

## Known Bugs

_{The date of the date retrieval is computed by Grenwich time which puts it ahead of Pacific local time.  }_
